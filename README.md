## /GitHub/Sync-SharedGhAssets.ps1

To use this script, install [Hub](https://github.com/github/hub) via [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/):

`iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://get.scoop.sh')` (with elevated credentials)

and then

`scoop install hub`

In order for the script to create pull requests silently, without opening text editors, have a 32-bit Notepad++ installed and run:

`git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"`

The script relies on [stored GitHub credentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/repos/git/set-up-credential-managers) of the current user.
